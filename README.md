# Excel_Financial_Analytics
I have organized, visualized, and analyzed financial information downloaded from Bloomberg.
I have gotten into the shoes of an analyst who has been asked to crunch financial data of Adidas company.
Also had to show this data in a crisp way that can be easily understood by the manager and stakeholders
Excel lookup functions came in handy while doing this project.
Not only formulas and functions, but in order to make this look professional added a lot of professional formatting to my Analysis
Created easy-to-interpret chart so that end-users can actually digest the data effortlessly.
